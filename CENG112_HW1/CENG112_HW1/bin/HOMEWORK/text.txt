A computer is a programmable machine designed to automatically carry out a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations
In the beginning, computers were as big as a large room. It is only later that they have become smaller and smaller, accessible to anyone. This has given way to personal computers. Later developers created new applications to help users perform many things from word processing to image editing. A large scale of programs, some free and others costly, have opened new horizons in information technology.
Now computers have noticeable impact on social relations. They have enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing. With the Internet, working with computers has become part of our daily lives thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access. In addition to face to face communication that characterized humans for centuries, a new form of virtual communication has become more predominant.
